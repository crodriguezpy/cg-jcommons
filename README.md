#cg-jcommons

A Java library with general utilities, interfaces, and other classes reused across multiple projects. Most items found here have undoubtably been implemented many times over and are already available in other far more exhaustive and complete packages (e.g. Guava). However, my intentions are to minimize dependencies within my projects by building over my own commons-library with additions only as-needed.
